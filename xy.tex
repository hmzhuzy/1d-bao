{\it Introduction.}---The standard BAO reconstruction uses the negative
Zel'dovich (linear) displacement to reverse the large-scale bulk flows 
\cite{2007bao}. 
The nonlinear density field is usually smoothed on the linear scale 
($\sim10\ \mr{Mpc}/h$) to make the Zel'dovich approximation valid.
Actually, the fully nonlinear displacement which describes the motion beyond
the linear order (the Zel'dovich approximation) can be solved from the nonlinear
density field.
While the algorithm is complicated in the three spatial dimensions, it is 
quite simple in the 1D case, which is basically the ordering of mass elements.
The 1D cosmological dynamics corresponds to the interaction of infinite sheets
of matter where the force is independent of distance \cite{2016matt}.
These sheets are moving in a Hubble flow relative to one another and the surface
density in each sheet scales as $a^{-2}$.
The simplified 1D dynamics provides an excellent means of understanding the 
structure formation and testing perturbation theories \cite{2016matt}.
In this Letter, we solve the fully nonlinear displacement in 1D and present
a new method to reconstruct the linear BAO information.
%=======================================


{\it Simulations.}---To simulate the gravitational dynamics in 1D, we use the 
1D particle-mesh (PM) code in Ref. \cite{2016matt}.
The 1D simualtion we use involves $3\times10^8$ sheets with $3\times10^8$ PM
elements in a $10^8\ \mr{Mpc}$ box.
The initial condition is generated under the Zel'dovich approximation.
Since the Zel'dovich approximation is exact up to shell crossing, we start 
the PM calculation at $z=10$. In our analysis, we use the output at $z=0$.
We scale the initial density field by the linear growth factor to get the
linear density field at $z=0$.
%=======================================

{\it Reconstruction algorithm.}---The nonlinear Lagrangian displacement 
can be solved easily in 1D by the ordering of mass elements.

(1) Solve the displacement $\Psi(q)$ field by ordering of the mass elements.

(2) Take the differential derivative of $\Psi(q)$ to get the reconstructed
density field $\delta_r(\bm{q})=-\nabla_{\bm{q}}\Psi(\bm{q})$.
$\delta_r(\bm{q})=-\partial\Psi(q)/\partial q$.

To solve the displacement field, we combine grids to get two fields with
five PM elements per grid and ten PM elements per grid, respectively.

Reconstruction from the gridded density field can be implemented following
the same principle, which we adopt in the following calculations 
\tcb{to be updated}
%=======================================



{\it Results.}---Figure \ref{fig:ps} shows the linear, nonlinear and reconstructed power spectra,
as well as the cross-corrlation power spectra.
The correlation of the reconstruction density field $\delta_r$ with the linear
density field $\delta_L$ is much better than that of the raw nonlinear density 
field $\delta$. The wiggles in the reconstructed power spectrum are also much 
more transparent than the raw nonlinear power spectrum.

\vspace{-0.7cm}
\caption{The power spectra of the linear (dashed line), nonlinear (thick solid
line), and reconstructed (thin solid line) fields. 
We also plot the nonlinear-linear (thick dotted line) and 
reconstructed-linear (thin dotted line) cross-correlation power spectra.}
\label{fig:ps}
\end{figure}

To convenienty quantify the linear information $\delta_L$ in 
the nonlinear density field $\delta$, we decompose the nonlinear density field
$\delta$ as
\begin{eqnarray}
\delta(\bm{k})=b(\bm{k})\delta_L(\bm{k})+\delta_N(\bm{k}).
\end{eqnarray}
Here, $b\delta_L$ is completely correlated with the linear density field 
$\delta_L$ and $b=P_{\delta\delta_L}/P_{\delta_L}$.
Nonlinear evolution drives $b$ to drop from unity, reducing the linear signal.
$\delta_N$ is generated in the nonlinear evolution and thus uncorrelated with
the linear density field $\delta_L$, further reducing $b\delta_L$ with respect
to $\delta$. This part induces noises in the measurement of BAO. 
Hence we denote it with a subscript ``$N$''. 
Such decomposition helps to write the nonlinear power spectrum as
\bea
P_\delta(k)=\mathcal{D}(k)P_{\delta_L}(k)+P_{\delta_N}(k),
\eea
where $\mathcal{D}=b^2$ describes the damping of the linear power specturm.
The reconstructed power spectrum $P_{\delta_r}$ can be describe in the same way.
Here, $b(\bm{k})$ is often referred as the ``propagator'' 
and $n(\bm{k})$ is usually
called the mode-coupling term \cite{2006crocce,2008crocce,2008matsubara}.
\tcb{still to be modified}

\caption{The damping factors for the nonlinear (thin solid line) and 
reconstructed (thick solid line) fields. The Gaussian BAO damping models with 
$\Sigma=20\ \mr{Mpc}$ (thick dotted line) and $\Sigma=10\ \mr{Mpc}$ (thin dotted
line).}
\label{fig:damp}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:damp} shows the damping functions for the raw and reconstructed 
fields. The nonlinear damping of the linear power spectrum is 
significantly reduced after reconstruction. We also overplot the best-fitting 
Gaussian BAO damping model,
\bea
\mathcal{D}(k)=\mr{e}^{-k^2\Sigma^2/2},
\eea
with $\Sigma=?\ \mr{Mpc}$ and $?\ \mr{Mpc}$ for the nonlinear and reconstructed 
fields. The new BAO reconstruction algorithm reduces the the nonlinear damping
scale $\Sigma$ by ?? per cent, i.e., a of ??. The damping factor is above 0.9
for $k\lesssim?\ \mr{Mpc}^{-1}$ indicating (almost) perfect reconstruction. 
\tcb{how to best quantify the reduction of damping? }
However, the 100 per cent reconstruction, cancelling any nonlinear effects,
is still unachievable, as some information has been irreversibly lost. (more 
discissions)

\begin{figure}[tbp]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.48\textwidth]{f7x.eps}
\end{center}
\vspace{-0.7cm}
\caption{The $\delta-\delta_L$ correlation coefficients at $z=0$ (solid
line) and $z=3$ (dotted line), as well as the $\delta_r-\delta_L$ 
correlation coefficient (dashed line).}
\label{fig:xcc}
\end{figure}

Reconstruction also reduces the noise term $P_{\delta_N}$. To demonstrate this,
in Fig. \ref{fig:xcc} we plot the  cross-correltion coefficient 
\bea
r(k)=\frac{P_{\delta\delta_L}(k)}
{\sqrt{P_{\delta}(k)P_{\delta_L}(k)}}
=\frac{1}{\sqrt{1+\eta(k)}},
\eea
where $\eta=P_n/(\mathcal{D}P_{\delta_L})$ quantifies the relative amplitude
of $\delta_N$ with respect to $b\delta_L$. The correlation of $\delta_r$ with
$\delta_L$ is as good as that of $\delta$ at $z=3$.
\tcb{how to quantify this better?}

{\it Discussions.}---The new method significantly
improves the expansion rate measurement from BAO. (more discussions?) 


This method can be generalized to the 3D case. 
We leave this
to future work.



Comparision with and Implications for the standard BAO reconstruction: exact 
Lagrangian displacement,
nonlinear displacement, which is easier to model.

If use the displacement solved in this paper for the standard BAO rec, we expect
the performance will become much better but still not as good as our results.
